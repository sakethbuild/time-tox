Since drug administration (core treatment) occurs on these days, the 'core_treatment' category takes precedence for these overlapping days.; Q2M (every 2 months) follow-up visits for overall survival are not counted as mandatory in-person contact days, as the protocol states they can occur via telephone, email, or clinic visit, and the table does not explicitly mandate an in-person clinic visit for these follow-ups.; The End of Treatment (EoT) visit is assumed to occur after Day +365, as treatment is 'until progression' and the 30-day EoT visit would follow the last dose, which is assumed to be around Day 364 for calculation purposes within the 365-day horizon."
